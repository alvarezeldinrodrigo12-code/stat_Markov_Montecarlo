# ðŸ”¢ The Origins of Markov Chains  ( and the Monte Carlo Method )

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project was created to play around with some of the examples shown in [this video by Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZeIEiBrT_w). 
Inside this notebook **you will find theory, examples and support notes** that I found interesting.
I'm open to hearing your thoughts (including additional material to complement the exercise) 

**Have fun!!**
